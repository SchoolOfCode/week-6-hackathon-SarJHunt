/* Thanks for trying out my kata for size! It's a bit of edu-tainment - solving a challenge and learning some fun sports facts along the way.

- Create a function that calculates a country's total tournament wins across the World Cup and Euros since 1970, using the two lists below.
- If the country is included, it should return the total number of wins. You should account for the input of a country that is not listed, and also the input of a country regardless of whether it is uppercase or lowercase.
- For example, if the country is France, the number of total wins will be 4 - they have won 2 World Cups and 2 Euros.

- The solution is in the answer.js file if you get stuck!


export function countryTotalWins(worldCups, euros, country) {
